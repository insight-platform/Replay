Installation
============

Software Requirements
---------------------

Prebuilt Replay packages are distributed as Docker images, so regardless of the platform and OS distributive, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

If you do not want to run Replay in Docker, you can build it from source or contact us for building binaries for your platform.

Docker Images for ARM64 and X86_64 are available on GitHub Container Registry:

- `replay-x86 <https://github.com/insight-platform/Replay/pkgs/container/replay-x86>`_ - for X86_64 CPUs;
- `replay-arm64 <https://github.com/insight-platform/Replay/pkgs/container/replay-arm64>`_ - for ARM64 CPUs.
